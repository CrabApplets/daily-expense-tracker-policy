    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 1, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Daily Expense Tracker</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Daily Expense Tracker mobile application (the "App") handles information and data.</p>

    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <p>Daily Expense Tracker <strong>does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data</strong> from users. All expense entries and related data you create within the App remain stored locally on your device and are never sent to our servers or any third party.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
      <li>Financial account credentials, bank data, payment provider data, or transaction data sent to a server.</li>
      <li>Usage analytics, advertising identifiers, or third-party tracking data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short: any data you type into the App (for example, expense amounts, categories, notes) is stored only on your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device's internal storage. We do not have access to your stored data. If you uninstall the App or clear the App’s data via your device settings, the information will be removed from your device and cannot be recovered by us.</p>
    <p>We recommend you back up any important data manually if you plan to uninstall the App or perform a factory reset on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request minimal device permissions required for on-device functionality (for example, permission to read/write local storage if needed). These permissions are used only for local operation and are never used to transmit data off your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate analytics services, advertising SDKs, crash-reporting tools, cloud backup services, or other third-party services that collect or transmit user data. If you choose to export data manually (for example, share a CSV file from the App), that export action is initiated by you and any resulting file transfer is handled by your device’s sharing mechanism (email, cloud storage, etc.). We are not involved in or responsible for the handling of that exported file by third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Because the App does not collect personal information, it does not knowingly collect or process personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us at <a href="mailto:crabapplets@outlook.com">crabapplets@outlook.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Control Over Data</h2>
    <p>Because all data is local, you have full control over it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Delete data from within the App (if the App provides delete controls).</li>
      <li>Uninstall the App to remove all stored data from your device.</li>
      <li>Export data manually using the App's export feature (if present) and then handle the exported file using your chosen method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the App or applicable laws. When changes are made, the "Last updated" date at the top will be revised. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the App’s handling of data, please contact us at:</p>
